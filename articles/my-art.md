My art is not driven by money.

Two years ago I figured out how to make $2,000/day passively. I could make more, but I’m not greedy.

I’d rather not get into the details. It involves Coinstar and Redbox — adjacent.

My art —

_Spilling pop on regulars at the Hollywood Bowl. I film it, make a flip book, then give flip book to victim._

I used to refinish guitars. That’s how I found out I was good. I bought Squiers and painted them to look like vintage Fenders. Great money.

When people ask what I do I panic.

I made blank flash cards with different color borders. Sold like crazy.

Stay away from perishables and the internet. That’s my advice. And think passive; you can’t spend money when you’re asleep.
